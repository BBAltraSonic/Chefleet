# Change: Add High-Fidelity Designs & Motion Specs

## Why
To establish a comprehensive visual design system and motion behavior specification that enables direct translation to Flutter animation code, ensuring consistent UI implementation across all core surfaces of the Chefleet app.

## What Changes
- **NEW**: Complete UI component specification with dimensions, constraints, and visual states
- **NEW**: Motion system with animation curves, durations, and triggers
- **NEW**: Component namespace for Flutter implementation (ChefleetCard, ChefleetFAB, etc.)
- **NEW**: Layout constraints and breakpoint definitions
- **NEW**: Glass morphism design language specifications

## Impact
- Affected specs: ui-design, motion-system (new capabilities)
- Affected code: Flutter widget library, animation controllers, theme system
- Affected teams: Design, Frontend development, UX testing
